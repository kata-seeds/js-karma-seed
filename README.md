# [Kata Seeds](http://kata-seeds.github.io): JavaScript + [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) (with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/))
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/js-karma-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/js-karma-seed)

## Getting Started

Clone this repo with `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/kata-seeds/js-seed.git
    cd js-seed

Install dependencies and run your tests with `make`:

    make

You should eventually see 1 test ran and 0 failures. If `make` doesn't work for you, npm probably has some comments that can help you out, otherwise please open an issue.

To run your tests during a kata, use `npm test` to run once, or use `npm run karma` to
use a watcher to check for file changes.

Now you can start your kata! May we suggest the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)?
